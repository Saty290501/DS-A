/*
A scope is a region of the program and broadly speaking there are three places, 
where variables can be declared âˆ’
Inside a function or a block which is called local variables,
In the definition of function parameters which is called formal parameters.
Outside of all functions which is called global variables.

Local Variable:-->> Variables that are declared inside a function or block are local variables.

Global Variable:-->> Global variables are defined outside of all the functions, usually on top of the program. 
                     The global variables will hold their value throughout the life-time of your program.
