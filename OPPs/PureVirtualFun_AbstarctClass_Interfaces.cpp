/*
You can see how an abstract class defined an interface in terms of calculateArea() 
and 3 other classes implemented same function but with different algorithm to calculate the area specific to the shape.

A pure virtual function is a member function which is declared within a base class and implemented in a derived class.
The classes which are containing pure virtual function are the abstract classes.
All the derived classes must define the pure virtual function.
If the derived class does not define the pure virtual function; it will not throw any error but the derived class becomes an abstract class.
