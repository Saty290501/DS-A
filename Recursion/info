When a function calls itself, its called Recursion. It will be easier for those who have seen the movie Inception. 
Leonardo had a dream, in that dream he had another dream, in that dream he had yet another dream, and that goes on. 
So it's like there is a function called dream() , and we are just calling it in itself.

function dream()
    print "Dreaming"
    dream()

Recursion is useful in solving problems which can be broken down into smaller problems of the same kind. 
But when it comes to solving problems using Recursion there are several things to be taken care of. 
Let's take a simple example and try to understand those. 
Following is the pseudo code of finding factorial of a given number  using recursion.

int fact(int n){
    //Base Case 
    if (n==0)     // Without a base case, we will get a segmentation fault 
    {
        return 1;
    }

    //Recursive Relation
    return n * fact(n - 1);
}
